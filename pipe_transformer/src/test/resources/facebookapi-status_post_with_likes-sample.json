I just want to say as a mother of youngs boys, they also like to shop and get cool things just as much as girls do. Its not about what gender they are it's because they are young and new cool things with their favourite character on it is exciting...for girls and boys. Thank you once again for the fast response and I look forward to seeing more of a variety in the boys section.",

  "message": "Hi, Why is it that you have 4 different types of 'Frozen' backpacks for girls plus other designs. Such as Peppa Pig, Cinderella and Blinki Princess but you have only 3 designs for boys, which consist of Thomas, Avengers and Minions. A pretty shocking selection in comparison. Why is there always more of a selection for girls over boys. It makes it very difficult to shop or find things for my sons as there simply a limited choice for them! What about Cars, Ninja Turtles or Hotwheels???",
